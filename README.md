# Word Counter

Minimal word counter app that I made because I was getting fed up with wordcounter.net enshittifying. 

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

3. Build for production:
    ```bash
    bun build
    ```

### VS Code Integration

For the best development experience, install the [Prettier VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and the [Ripple VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ripple-TS.ripple-ts-vscode-plugin).
